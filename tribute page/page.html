    <p>William Henry Gates III (born October 28, 1955) is an American business magnate, software developer, investor, author, and philanthropist. 
    He is a co-founder of Microsoft, along with his late childhood friend Paul Allen. During his career at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of chairman, 
    chief executive officer (CEO), president and chief software architect, while also being the largest individual shareholder until May 2014.
    <br>
    <br>
    
    He was a major entrepreneur of the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s.
      
    Since 1987, Gates has been included in the Forbes list of the world's wealthiest people.From 1995 to 2017, he held the Forbes title of the richest person in the world every year except from 2010 to 2013.In October 2017, he was surpassed by Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos, who had an estimated net worth of US$90.6 billion compared to Gates's net worth of US$89.9 billion at the time.As of September 2022, Gates had an estimated net worth of US$114 billion, making him the fifth-richest person in the world.
    <br>
    <br>
    Early in his life, Gates observed that his parents wanted him to pursue a law career. When he was young, his family regularly attended a church of the Congregational Christian Churches, a Protestant Reformed denomination.Gates was small for his age and was bullied as a child.The family encouraged competition; one visitor reported that "it didn't matter whether it was hearts or pickleball or swimming to the dock; there was always a reward for winning and there was always a penalty for losing".
    <br>
    <br>
    Gates approved of many decisions that led to antitrust litigation over Microsoft's business practices. In the 1998 United States v. Microsoft case, Gates gave deposition testimony that several journalists characterized as evasive. He argued with examiner David Boies over the contextual meaning of words such as "compete", "concerned", and "we". Later in the year, when portions of the videotaped deposition were played back in court, the judge was seen laughing and shaking his head.
